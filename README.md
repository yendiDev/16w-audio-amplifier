# Simple 16W AB Class Audio Amplifier with TDA2030 IC

This project is a PCB design for an audio amplifier based on the TDA2030 integrated circuit. The TDA2030 is a low-frequency class AB amplifier known for its high output power and low harmonic distortion. This amplifier is designed to drive speakers with high efficiency and minimal distortion.

## Features

- **TDA2030 IC**: Provides high-fidelity audio amplification with low distortion.
- **Dual Power Supply**: Operates with a ±12V to ±18V power supply for optimal performance.
- **High Output Power**: Delivers up to 18W of continuous output power with proper heat dissipation.
- **Low Harmonic Distortion**: Ensures clear sound reproduction with minimal noise.
- **Screw Terminals**: Provided for secure speaker and power connections.
- **Capacitive Coupling**: Uses capacitors to block DC components and allow clean AC signal amplification.

## Components Used

- TDA2030 Integrated Circuit
- Electrolytic Capacitors (470µF, 1000µF, etc.)
- Ceramic Capacitors (0.1µF, 100nF)
- Resistors (1Ω, 4.7Ω, 100kΩ, etc.)
- Diodes (1N4007)

## Circuit Design

The circuit is designed to amplify audio signals while ensuring stability and protection. It follows a standard class AB configuration with a split power supply. The input signal passes through a coupling capacitor to prevent DC offset. The feedback network is optimized for gain control and frequency response.


## Applications

- DIY audio amplifier projects
- Speaker enhancement systems
- Home theater audio setups
- Subwoofer amplifiers
